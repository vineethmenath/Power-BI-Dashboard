**ShopNest E-commerce Analytics Dashboard**

**Project Overview**

This project features the ShopNest E-commerce Analytics Dashboard, a comprehensive data analysis of an e-commerce platform connected to small businesses in Portugal. The analysis is structured into three key levels: Product, Order, and Customer.
The goal of this project is to provide actionable insights into product performance, operational efficiency, and customer behavior to guide business strategy, inventory management, and marketing efforts.

**Key Features and Analysis**

The analysis in the dashboard focuses on three main areas:
1. Product Level Analysis
 * Total Revenue and Total Sales: The dashboard highlights a Total Revenue of $15.40M and 13.59M units in total sales.
 * Top-Selling Products: Identifies the product categories that contribute the most to revenue, with Health & Beauty ($1.35M) and Watches & Gifts ($1.26M) being the highest.
 * Delayed Orders Analysis: Tracks orders where the actual delivery date was later than the estimated date. Key categories with high delays include Bed, Bath & Table (770) and Health & Beauty (716).
 * Product Rating: Highlights high-satisfaction products like CDS, DVDs, and Musicals (Avg. 4.67) and low-rated products like Security and Services (Avg. 2.50).
2. Order Level Analysis
 * On-time vs. Delayed Orders: Compares the monthly trend of on-time versus delayed deliveries, noting that on-time deliveries dominate, though some months (e.g., month 4) show a higher rate of delays.
 * Yearly and Quarterly Revenue Trends: Visualizes seasonal sales patterns. 2018 had the highest overall revenue, and Q4 showed stronger performance in some years, possibly due to holiday sales.
3. Customer Level Analysis
 * Regional Sales Performance: Analyzes sales by city and state. Sao Paulo (SP) is the top-performing city, generating $3,136,175.44 in revenue, which is significantly higher than other regions.
 * Payment Method Analysis: Identifies customer payment preferences. The Credit Card is the most preferred method, accounting for 73.92% of payments, followed by Boleto at 19.04%.


**Tools Used**

 * | Microsoft Excel | Data cleaning, transformation, and creation of data tables for analysis. |

 * | Power BI | (Original Tool) Used for creating the comprehensive analytics dashboard and visualizations. |

**Conclusion**

The ShopNest Analytics Dashboard provides critical insights that can drive strategic business decisions:
 * Operational Focus: The high number of delayed orders, especially for popular products like Bed, Bath & Table and Health & Beauty, indicates a need for operational improvements in logistics and the supply chain to boost customer satisfaction.
 * Sales Strategy: Credit Card preference and the high revenue contribution from Sao Paulo suggest focusing marketing and service efforts on these areas to maximize growth.
 * Quality Improvement: The consistently low-rated products (e.g., Security and Services) require immediate attention for quality improvement and better customer support to enhance brand reputation and retention.
This analysis provides a strong foundation for ShopNest to optimize its operations, product offerings, and customer experience.
